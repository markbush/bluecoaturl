A database of categorised URLs.  Secure Computing initially acquired "!WebTrack" from Webster Technologies - a company based in Florida and began the process of rebranding to !SmartFilter around 1997.

Over the following years the database and number of categories grew due to customer requirements and market competition.  Secure Computing went on to acquire !N2H2 (a more education-focused product) and !WebWasher (as part of the !CyberGuard acquisition).

!SmartFilter is the product currently in use where this application was designed for.
